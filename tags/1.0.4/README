COMPILING with Qt only

 * Juct run qmake and then make, as usually.


COMPILING with Ruby

 * You should have installed Ruby programming language and installed Mxx_ru gem.
   Run in the command prompt: gem install Mxx_ru.

 * After this you have to configure MxxRu: make "MXX_RU_CPP_TOOLSET" system enveronment
   with "vc10" value, for example if you have Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0 installed. All
   possible values for this enveronment you can see in the documentation by MxxRu
   (http://rubyforge.org/docman/view.php/1361/10706/mxx_ru-1.5.3.pdf).

 * And now just run build.rb which is a Ruby program and compillation process will start.
